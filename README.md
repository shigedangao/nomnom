## Dodo - Lib

A small crates is available which provided a list of utility method to interact with the cedict and doing some pinyin conversion. Below is how you can use the crate to load the cedict

```rust
use dodo_zh;
use dodo_zh::KeyVariant;

fn main() {
    // The KeyVariant can either be Traditional or Simplified chinese
    let cedict = dodo_zh::load_cedict_dictionary(path, KeyVariant::Traditional).unwrap();
    let wo = cedict.items.get("æˆ‘").unwrap();

    // will return an Item struct
    println!(wo.translations);
}
```

A set of example exist which can helps you to see how to do some pinyin manipulation. Namely
convert the pinyin with tone number to a pinyin with tone marker etc...

You can run the example with the following command

```rust
cargo run --example pinyin
```
